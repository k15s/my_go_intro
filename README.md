##Numbers

**Fibonacci Sequence** - Enter a number and have the program generate the Fibonacci sequence to that number or to the Nth number.
[code](fibonacci/fibonacci.go)

**Prime Factorization** - Have the user enter a number and find all Prime Factors (if there are any) and display them.
[code](prime_factors/primes.go)

**Next Prime Number** - Have the program find prime numbers until the user chooses to stop asking for the next one.
[code](next_prime/primes.go)

**Factorial Finder** - The Factorial of a positive integer, n, is defined as the product of the sequence n, n-1, n-2, ...1 and the factorial of zero, 0, is defined as being 1. Solve this using both loops and recursion.
[code](factorial/factorial.go)

**Change Return Program** - The user enters a cost and then the amount of money given. The program will figure out the change and the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies needed for the change.
[code](change/change.go)

**Find Cost of Tile to Cover W x H Floor** - Calculate the total cost of tile it would take to cover a floor plan of width and height, using a cost entered by the user.
[code](floor_cost/floor.go)

**Sorting Algorithms** - Sorting algorithm implementations
[code](sorting_algorithms/main.go)
